# Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Risk Prediction


## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Risk Prediction project! In the financial industry, individuals often seek lines of credit using their homes as collateral. This project aims to leverage machine learning models to forecast the creditworthiness of homeowners applying for a HELOC. The dataset used for this project is an opensource dataset provided by the FICO community, focusing on credit history instances.

The primary goal is to determine whether an applicant will be able to repay their HELOC account within two years based on their credit report information. The project also emphasizes the importance of model explainability in understanding complex machine learning models, promoting transparency, and mitigating biases.

## 2. Problem Definition

### 2.1. Problem Statement

The financial industry possesses extensive datasets related to consumers and their credit history. By combining these datasets with efficient machine learning models, we aim to automate the decision-making process for creditworthiness assessment. Additionally, addressing challenges such as model explainability is crucial to reduce fraud, eliminate biases, and enhance transparency in decision-making.

### 2.2. Project Motivation

Automation of credit risk estimation is a common application of machine learning in finance. This project seeks to streamline the credit risk estimation process by accurately identifying risks associated with customers applying for credit products. The motivation lies in creating a transparent machine learning model that not only automates decisions but also provides understandable explanations.

## 3. Methodology

The project follows a comprehensive machine learning workflow to achieve its goals. The key steps include:

1. **Dataset Description, Pre-processing & Trends:** Understanding the HELOC dataset, performing necessary pre-processing, and identifying trends in the financial records of anonymized consumers.

2. **Relevant Heuristic Features for Credit Risk Prediction:** Identifying key features that contribute to credit risk prediction, helping to build effective machine learning models.

3. **Machine Learning Model Implementation:** Building machine learning models to predict credit risk based on the identified features.

4. **Explainability:** Ensuring the models are interpretable and providing insights into the factors influencing creditworthiness decisions.

5. **Creation of a User Interface:** Developing a user interface to interact with the model and visualize results.

## 4. Dataset Description, Pre-Processing & Trends

The HELOC dataset contains financial records of anonymized consumers, allowing the evaluation of creditworthiness. This dataset, provided by the FICO community, focuses on homeowners and their home equity. It includes 23 numeric variables, describing factors such as trade duration, satisfactory trades, and consumer delinquency.
