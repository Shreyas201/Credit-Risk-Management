# Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Risk Prediction

### Overview

This project focuses on assessing an applicant's ability to repay their HELOC account within two years using their credit report data. It emphasizes the significance of model explainability in comprehending complex machine learning models, fostering transparency, and addressing biases. The dataset utilized is sourced from the FICO community, specifically designed to analyze credit history instances.

### Methodology

The project follows a comprehensive machine-learning workflow to achieve its goals. The key steps include:

1. **Dataset Description, Pre-processing & Trend Analysis:** Understanding the HELOC dataset, performing essential pre-processing tasks, and uncovering trends in the financial records of anonymized consumers.

2. **Identification of Relevant Heuristic Features for Credit Risk Prediction:** Identifying critical features that contribute to credit risk prediction, facilitating the development of effective machine learning models.

3. **Implementation of Machine Learning Models:** Building robust machine learning models capable of predicting credit risk based on the identified features.

4. **Model Explainability:** Ensuring interpretability of the models and providing insights into the factors influencing creditworthiness decisions.

5. **User Interface Development:** Creating an intuitive user interface to interact with the model and visualize the prediction results.
