# Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Risk Prediction

### Overview

This project focuses on assessing an applicant's ability to repay their HELOC account within two years using their credit report data. It emphasizes the significance of model explainability in comprehending complex machine learning models, fostering transparency, and addressing biases. The dataset utilized is sourced from the FICO community, specifically designed to analyze credit history instances.

### Methodology

The project follows a comprehensive machine-learning workflow to achieve its goals. The key steps include:

1. **Dataset Description, Pre-processing & Trends:** Understanding the HELOC dataset, performing necessary pre-processing, and identifying trends in the financial records of anonymized consumers.

2. **Relevant Heuristic Features for Credit Risk Prediction:** Identifying key features that contribute to credit risk prediction, helping to build effective machine learning models.

3. **Machine Learning Model Implementation:** Building machine learning models to predict credit risk based on the identified features.

4. **Explainability:** Ensuring the models are interpretable and providing insights into the factors influencing creditworthiness decisions.

5. **Creation of a User Interface:** Developing a user interface to interact with the model and visualize results.
